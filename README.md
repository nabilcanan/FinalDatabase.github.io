In this project I created a grocery store database.
This database consisted of several aisles with product numbers, weight, name etc. 
The script for this database was created by me and you can use DB Browser to execute the database table.

The gui allows the user to go through the CRUD method, Create, Read, Update, and Delete items from the database.

The following queries should display the correct output in DB Browser.
Select * from "any table" 
Select * from aisle
Select * from Meat
Select * from Dairy

Select * from Steak 
Where Steak = "red"
